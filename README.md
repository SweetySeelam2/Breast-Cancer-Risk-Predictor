# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Risk Predictor Dashboard (Power BI)

## üéØ Transparent AI-Powered Cancer Diagnosis using Logistic Regression + SHAP

---

## # Overview

This Power BI dashboard uses an interpretable AI approach to detect breast cancer. It combines:

- A reliable **Logistic Regression** classifier
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for transparent feature attribution
- Real-time interactive **Power BI visual analytics**

Built to help **clinicians, radiologists, and healthcare leaders** make fast, accurate, and trustworthy diagnostic decisions.

## # Dataset

- üìä **Source**: [UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))
- üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Patients**: 114
- üß¨ **Features**: 30 numeric diagnostic measures (mean, worst, SE)
- üéØ **Target**: Benign (0) vs. Malignant (1)

## # Dashboard KPIs

| Metric                        | Value           |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| ‚úÖ Prediction Accuracy        | **98.2%**       |
| üîç Average Risk Probability   | **38.9%**       |
| üî¨ Malignant Predictions      | **41 patients** |
| üìä Total Patients             | **114**         |
| üí• Top Global SHAP Feature    | `texture_worst` |

## # Dashboard Pages

### üîπ Page 1: Global SHAP Drivers
- Shows **top global features** impacting predictions.
- Bar chart built on **sum of SHAP values**, not model coefficients.
- Top feature: **`texture_worst`**

### üîπ Page 2: Patient-Level Explanation
- Select any patient to explore their:
  - Diagnosis
  - Prediction confidence
  - SHAP waterfall: pushing toward benign/malignant
- Enhances **clinical trust** and **patient-specific storytelling**.

### üîπ Page 3: SHAP Clustering Segments
- Patients grouped into **behavioral SHAP clusters**.
- Cluster-level KPIs:
  - Top SHAP feature
  - Average risk %
  - Malignant rate %
  - SHAP scatter & feature maps

---

## # Conclusion

- The model correctly predicted **98.2% of all cases**, including **all 41 malignant cases**.
- SHAP global + local explainability makes results **clinically interpretable**.
- Ideal for **clinical decision support, diagnostics labs, and digital health startups**.

## # Business Impact (2025)

1. üí∏ **Cost Reduction**  
   Early detection of malignant cases can save **$11K‚Äì$17K per patient** on average.

2. üí° **Revenue Opportunity**  
   A 10% improvement in early detection could lead to **$500K+ annual savings** per mid-sized hospital (KPMG, 2025).

3. ‚öïÔ∏è **Enhanced Trust**  
   Transparent AI increases clinician adoption, reduces litigation risk, and enables **shared decision-making**.

## # Business Recommendations

- ‚úÖ **Deploy** this system in hospitals and diagnostics centers with EHR integration.
- üìä **Use dashboards** in tumor board reviews to explain diagnostic rationale.
- üß† **Segment patients** using SHAP clusters to personalize diagnostics and follow-up.
- üîÑ **Track model drift** by continuously monitoring prediction quality in Power BI.
